# BMEN415 Final Project
## Group 2

This is the GitHub Repository for the BMEN 415 Winter 2023 Final Project, where we did a complete regression and classification analysis of a Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Water Potability dataset, respectively. We also performed an exploratory data analysis on an image-based dataset called Chest X-Rays, which focusses on detecting pneumonia.
